					Howdy! Welcome to my website. This website is a portfolio meant to hold my work, project, and service experience, 
					as well as my plans for the future. So, without further ado, I'll introduce myself:
				</p1>
				<br><br>
				<p1>
					My name is Braeden Smith and I'm a Junior at Texas A&M graduating in Spring 2024! I am a Computer Science major 
					seeking a software engineering internship or co-op for the summer, or a full-time software development position 
					after I graduate.
				</p1>
				<br><br>
				<p1>
					Having been learning and teaching others to code since middle school, I feel confident in my ability to program in 
					multiple languages; most notably C#, C++, Java, and Python. At Texas A&M, I have continued to expand upon that 
					knowledge, maintaining a 4.0 GPA while carrying upwards of 16 credit hours each semester and working over 25 hours 
					each week to contribute to the cost of my education. Being a part of Texas A&M's Help Desk Central has been 
					rewarding as I have been quickly promoted several times over the last year, most recently to Lead Trainer.
				</p1>
				<br><br>
				<p1>
					In addition to my educational and on-campus work experience, I had the opportunity to participate in a software 
					development internship with Marathon Petroleum in the fall of 2022. In my short time there, I was able to complete 
					a wide variety of projects including building webpages, resolving bugs, and making enhancements in an agile team. 
					Over my time at Marathon, I have been able to develop my collaborative software development skills as I worked 
					with a team to improve business efficiency.
				</p1>
				<br><br>
				<p1>
					In addition to my experience gained at Marathon, all of these opportunities have allowed me to further develop 
					my problem solving, time management, and leadership skills. I am confident that my foundational knowledge in 
					combination with my ability to rapidly learn new skills will allow me to succeed in this position and bring great 
					value to the team. I love technology, programming, and problem solving, and I am excited for the opportunity to 
					apply my skills in a practical scenario.
				</p1>

				<h1>Portfolio</h1>
				<p>The following are projects that I have worked on over the past few years:</p>
				<div class="portfolio-block">
					<img class="portfolio" height="250px" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90221641/154890438-7f02af72-7171-4200-938c-76fad7d1e27c.png">
					<h2>Ballz Clone</h2>
					<a href="https://github.com/BraedenSmith29/Ballz-Clone">GitHub Link</a>
					<p>A clone of the mobile game Ballz, which was pretty popular around 2018. I wrote this for my final project in my Junior year of High School. It's shockingly addicting.</p>
					<p>To play, just aim the mouse to turn the ball launcher, and click to fire. You will not be able to fire again until all of the balls return.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="portfolio-block">
					<img class="portfolio" height="250px" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90221641/155039294-bb3dced0-f0ab-4fa0-aab9-ed1eab397a5c.png">
					<h2>Jebediah's Adventure</h2>
					<a href="https://github.com/BraedenSmith29/Jebediahs-Adventure">GitHub Link</a>
					<p>Take control of Jebediah in this fast-paced platformer-shooter. Fight off an onslaught of aliens in an attempt to survive as long as possible! I made this game the summer before High School as my final project in a Unity course. It's kind of ridiculous, but it was a fun project to work on.</p>
					<p>The space key is your jetpack. Hold it to fly and press it for a short burst. 
						The A and D keys will move you right and left, respectively. 
						The gun is aimed with your mouse and fired by left-clicking. 
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="portfolio-block">
					<h2>Snake Tron</h2>
					<a href="https://github.com/BraedenSmith29/SnakeTron">GitHub Link</a>
					<p>SnakeTron is a combination of the games Snake and Tron. Eat apples to grow your snake in order to trap your opponent and claim victory. I wrote this game in Junior year of High School for my AP project. It's simple, but a good few minutes of fun if you have a friend. Enjoy!</p>
					<p>The pink snake is controlled by WASD and the blue snake is controlled by the arrow keys</p>

				<h1>Technical Skills</h1>
				<p>My technical skills include the following:</p>
				<p>Languages: C++, C#, Java, Python</p>
				<p>Tools: Unity3D, Git, Visual Studio, Linux, Blazor, Azure DevOps</p>
				<h1>Technical Areas of Interest</h1>
				<p>My technical area of interest is primarily in the software security space. Particularly, 
					I have been finding networking very interesting this semester. I am fascinated by the 
					science of protecting programs and networks from attack and trying to stay ahead of 
					malicious actors who would try to compromise my code. For this reason, I am pursuing 
					a cybersecurity minor.

				<h1>Completed Service</h1>
				<p>In High School, to give back to my community, I organized a class at the local library that would meet on
					a biweekly basis and teach young kids how to code. I developed a cirriculum based on Scratch, a block-based
					language designed for teaching programming. Once I had a solid plan, I worked with a partner to organize 
					the class and teach the kids. This went on for a few months before I moved to Texas and was not able to
					continue, but it was an awesome experience.
